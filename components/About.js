          I'm <span className="font-semibold text-white">Shruti Rathod</span>,
          a passionate software developer and full stack intern who enjoys building secure,
          smart and user-centric applications. My work blends clean UI/UX with practical functionality â€” powered by
          technologies like <span className="text-purple-300">Flask, JavaScript, Python, SQL, and React</span>.

        <p className="text-gray-400 text-md">
          I'm also deeply curious about Artificial Intelligence and Human-Computer Interaction,
          and love creating systems that are not only functional but thoughtfully designed for real-world use.
